# Introduction

Looks like you have successfully cloned the repository and are now looking at the introduction.

## The website

This repository contains an example website we'll be working on.
All the content of this website is in the html/js/css files here, and in the markdown files under /pages

Unfortunately, directly opening the index.html does not work.
So in order to run a small webserver on your machine, please open a terminal and navigate to where you put the workshop code, and run the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

You should not need to install anything other than python for this to work.

After running this in a terminal, you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000.
From there you can read the rest of this introduction

### How the website works

From here on you should be reading this in a webpage, not in a text editor or something else.

‚ùó Whenever you are done making edits, go back to this webpage to check and continue reading the instructions.

This website displays markdown files (simple text files that look nice) and displays a list of those files on the left side of the screen.

In order to do this, it reads a special text file at `pages/listing.txt`.
Each line in this file corresponds to a markdown file under `pages/`.
Lines starting with # are ignored as comments.

In these exercises, the files under this `pages/` directory are all that you will need to edit.

The first exercise will be `resolving-merge-conflicts.md`.
Go there by clicking the navigation item on the left.
More exercises will appear as you do stuff.
